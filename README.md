## Introduction

Welcome to the Seismic Activity Simulation project! This project aims to simulate seismic activity using the Gutenberg-Richter model, a widely accepted empirical law describing earthquake magnitude-frequency distribution. We employ libraries such as Matplotlib, HTML, Canva, and NumPy, along with numerical methods, to create accurate seismic activity approximations.

## Project Overview

Seismic activity simulations are crucial for understanding and predicting earthquakes. This project utilizes Gutenberg-Richter's model to estimate the distribution of earthquake magnitudes and their probabilities. Key components of the project include:

- Generating synthetic earthquake data.
- Analyzing and visualizing earthquake data with Matplotlib.
- Creating interactive HTML-based visualizations for analytical purposes.
- Employing Canva for the design of informative graphics.
- Utilizing numerical methods to make accurate approximations.
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy: `pip install numpy`
- Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
- Canva :`pip install Canva`


## Simulation Details

The seismic activity simulation is based on the Gutenberg-Richter model, which relates the number of earthquakes to their magnitudes.
